    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        The human brain undergoes significant changes during aging, affecting both its macrostructure (such as size and shape) and microstructure (the cellular-level properties of brain tissue), impacting its functionality and its relation to neurodegenerative diseases. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that aging leads to increased similarity of microstructural signatures between different brain regions within individuals, while across individuals, the microstructural signatures show greater variability. We developed a novel qMRI multi-parameter method to analyze 32 subjects and supported both hypotheses.
